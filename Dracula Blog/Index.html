            <p>The close or distant reading of a text, by a diverse group of editors, with the intent of creating a single, collaborative digital edition is a monumental task for those academics who are experts in the process.  For the students who have been actively learning the requisite skills and encoding languages, those very same students who have endeavoured to compile this edition of Bram Stoker’s famous novel Dracula, the task is seen as all the more daunting.  However, through reciprocal encouragement and discovery, the process moved forward and the result is presented here for any and all future investigations and discoveries to come.  Our team has developed a series of critical apparatuses by which they viewed the novel: many social, cultural, and political issues that have resonated through our studies at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan Campus.  It is through these lenses that we have arrived at our varied and comprehensive conclusions which we humbly, and thankfully present below.</p>

                <p>My critical apparatus was one that looks into how Stoker’s characters view their own subjectivity, as well as the subjectivity of others, through the media and technology that they create and engage with in order to tell their supernatural tale.  In Chapter XVII, Mina Harker, Jonathan Harker, and Dr. Seward in particular all present and construct multiple forms of expression which both solidify and complicate their preconceived notions of that subjectivity and permanence, which become even more impactful realizations as the novel reaches its conclusion.

                <p>Bram Stoker utilizes the physical narratives of the characters and their progression within time and space to inform the tone and emotion of the novel. Jonathan Harker is the first character in the novel to encounter the supernatural and experience the confusion of myth and reality that would pervade the entirety of the narrative, and his journey will heighten readers perception of the mythical world while simultaneously grounding the story in reality. I have created a storymap that will closely follow the physical travels of Jonathan Harker, to show how Stoker’s use of this narrative style raises important questions of ‘otherness’ and its effect on both characters and readers. The mysteriously (un)realistic setting of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, acts as a character of sorts and plays a vital role in the plot as a whole.

                <p>Hello, my name is Emily, and my encoded edition and critical apparatus are based on my research question on how to analyze the relationships in Chapter XVII of Dracula. I focus on the differences amid the platonic relationships of Mina and Arthur, and Mina and Dr. Seward. I chose Chapter XVII because of the touching scene between Mina and a grieving Arthur, as I was intrigued by the emphasis on strong platonic bonds as familial. My encoded edition homes in on dialogue between characters in order to categorize the type of relationship depicted. Whereas my critical apparatus is prominently about the relationship’s contrasts. Join my peers and I as we each discuss our separate studies on Bram Stoker’s Dracula.

                <p>Dracula isn’t just some regular old dude who goes around biting people for the heck of it. He’s a vampire, and he has a number of qualities that alienate him from everyone else— qualities that only heighten his effect as a villain and as an ‘other.’ His character can be broken down into four different types of ‘othernesses’, which are still prevalent in villain archetypes today. In this interactive Flash Actionscript program, click and hold around his portrait to reveal four of the count's distinct 'othernesses.'

                <p>My critical apparatus focuses on the eroticism in the third chapter of Dracula and how the diction Bram Stoker uses exemplifies this idea. Stoker uses language to give the female vampires power over Jonathan which is unlike how most women were perceived in the Victorian era, how ever this continuation of word choice still objectifies the female vampires and makes the story more erotic. Diction is what makes a story and I use this idea to look at specific components of chapter three.

Although the mediums through which their myths were and continue to be circulated differ, the trope of the erotic, violent vampire persist. My presentation takes particular interest in how the same basic character is described using variety of technology, which changes the audience’s relationship to him or her.

                    <p>Insane: “In a state of mind which prevents normal perception, behaviour or social interaction seriously mentally ill” (Oxford English Dictionary). Dracula by Bram Stoker is a well-known novel in which the journals, diaries and other personal collections from several individuals are compiled together to depict the grim tale of a Vampires attempts to immigrate to London. It ends happily enough with the main cast, mostly, alive and Dracula dead. . Is it possible that that Dracula had no ill intent towards Jonathan in the first few chapters of the Novel? Could Jonathans writings in the first four chapters have been the ramblings of a mad-man kept in isolation by a worried Count who was simply following the practices of the time?

                    In 1896, Dr Irwin wrote an article “The Insane Diathesis – Illusions, Hallucinations and Delusions” in which they wrote about people with a tendency towards insanity as well as a few indicators: Delusions and Hallucinations. He describes delusion as a false belief. In this case the belief that Dracula is a monster who has trapped him and has a consortium of other vampires which he feeds.
                    <br><br>
                    By the end of chapter four, Jonathan has mentioned the potential of dying and rationalised it in a way that borders on suicidal. An article from 1893 published by the British Medical Journal spoke to this. It argued that for one to throw away everything, they must have -even just for an instant – been in a state of insanity. It was a clear view of the time from these writings that to willingly throw yourself at death was the act of an insane man.
                    <br><br>
                    A final key piece of information to be considered was brought up by Raison, Klein, and Steckler in their article “The moon and madness reconsidered” (1999). This article addressed the fact that many, including medical practitioners of the time still believed, despite contrary evidence, that the moon was still capable of both causing and increasing the instances of insanity within individuals. This belief was so strong that some practitioners were known to actively bind and restrain their patients during the full moon whether previous behaviors and activities indicated they should do so or not. If this was the belief of medical practitioners, it is likely a safe assumption that Stoker and his characters also believed in the moons influence on lunatics.
                    <br><br>
                    I used Voyant to analyse Jonathans first four chapters worth of journal writings. Specifically, I sought out instances of the term’s death, escape, monster, prisoner, and god. All these terms, I found to be related to suicide, paranoia, delusions, and fear (hence god as a figure of support to a Churchgoing man). Finally, I inserted the term moon* and found that all the previous terms were most prevalent during instances where the moon was also mentioned. 
                    I propose that this strong correlation occurs since Jonathan has indeed gone insane. While he still maintains sanity enough to converse and rationalise his beliefs and actions, thoughts of death, monsters, and prejudices done against him increase during the moon due to what was at the time known as “moon-madness”.

                <p>The New Woman is a significant reference and lens to construct agency and female equality of the Victorian Era and within the novel Dracula. The New Woman   signalled a turn in cultural understanding of gender and sex, therein, shifts in knowledge and understanding about the place of a woman in society became challenged and critiqued. The New woman is a feminist term that sparked the invocation of female equality. The term aimed to highlight how  the male and female sex were diametrically apposed and confined to roles that were restrictive of that era and challenging or subverting these assumptions .The New Woman also prefaced a progressive shift from male domination and  female subordination which fouled assumptions about the capabilities of the female sex.  Bram Stoker’s Dracula interpolates gender and identity within throughout the novel mentioned significantly by the female characters of the novel such as Mina Murray Harker. Using the tool Voyant, exploration of the term and frequency of use aided in building a clear understanding the significance of The New Woman within the Victorian era and within the novel Dracula.
